            <p>It‚Äôs August in Texas, and things are heating up faster than a tube rig during a pileup!</p>
            <p>Luckily, heat was not a problem at our last club <span class="highlight">Potluck POTA</span> outing at
                Eisenhower State Park. We had around 40 folks show up, including some friendly faces from the Grayson
                County Amateur Radio Club. We wisely took refuge in the recreation hall, fully equipped with a kitchen,
                restrooms, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîcold air conditioning! While the bands played a little hard to get due
                to some solar activity, we still had some successful activations, shared great food, and enjoyed even
                better company. If you missed it, don‚Äôt worry‚Äîanother Potluck POTA is on the horizon later this year.
            </p>
            <p>Speaking of things heating up, our very own <span class="highlight">Bob DeVance ‚Äì K5CRX</span> has been
                teaching some outstanding classes. There are still two more sessions this month, so check out the events
                section on the club‚Äôs Discord server for details. Big thanks to Bob for volunteering his time and
                talent‚Äîeveryone who‚Äôs attended has walked away with more knowledge and a little extra confidence.</p>
            <p>Now, back to the heat. It‚Äôs summer in Texas, which means if you‚Äôre outdoors, you‚Äôre probably sweating.
                Whether you‚Äôre chasing contacts in a park or chasing the family at a beach, stay safe out there: wear
                sunscreen, seek shade, and drink water like it‚Äôs Field Day weekend and hydration is worth double points.
            </p>
            <p>Still with me on this "hot" theme? Let‚Äôs talk about a <span class="highlight">hot breakfast</span>! Every
                Saturday morning, a group of us gather at IHOP (northeast corner of Hwy 75 & 380). We roll in around
                7:00 AM and get our orders in by 7:30 AM. If you haven‚Äôt joined us yet, come on out‚Äîit‚Äôs good food, good
                laughs, and great fellowship.</p>
            <p>And don‚Äôt forget, our next general club meeting is coming up <span class="highlight">Tuesday, August
                    12</span> at Spring Creek BBQ in McKinney at 7:00 PM. Come early for show-and-tell and grab a
                plate of hot BBQ before the meeting kicks off. We always aim to keep things informative, welcoming, and
                a little bit fun.</p>
            <p>Alright, I promise‚Äîno more "hot" references! Stay cool, stay safe, and we‚Äôll catch you on the air or at
                the next meetup.</p>

            </strong>

            <p>MARC maintains a chat group on groups.io to facilitate club communication between meetings and
                newsletters. Sign up for this service by visiting <span
                    class="hyperlink">https://groups.io/g/McKinneyARC</span>. Your application
                will be approved quickly.</p>

            <p>The purposes of the MARC email reflector are: 1) Facilitate the timely distribution of MARC
                information and news to club members. 2) Allow for the sharing of amateur radio related topics among
                club members. 3) Provide a forum for the discussion of amateur related information among club
                members. 4) Act as a marketplace for the buying and selling of amateur radio and computer equipment
                and services. Club members should utilize good judgment with regard to topics or content that are
                posted on the MARC reflector. To that end it is recommended that political and religious topics or
                content be avoided unless directly related to amateur radio. In addition, personal attacks in any
                form will not be tolerated.</p>
