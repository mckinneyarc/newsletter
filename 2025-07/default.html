        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>
                June was a fantastic month for MARC! We had a strong showing at Field Day, and a huge thank you goes to our Field Day Director, Michael – W5MEF, for doing an outstanding job organizing the event! The weather was surprisingly kind for a Texas summer day, with a steady, gentle breeze that helped keep everyone reasonably comfortable. We couldn’t have pulled it off without the dedicated members who helped with setup and teardown, and of course, the operators who kept things running strong all day and night. It was especially exciting to see many new members and welcome several guests, including the crew from McKinney Fire Department Station #9.
            </p>

            <p>
                As we move into July, let’s take a moment to reflect on Independence Day and what it means to each of us, our families, and this great nation. Independence Day is a celebration of freedom, unity, and the enduring spirit of a people who believe in hope and justice. It's a time to honor those who fought for liberty and to appreciate the blessings of living in a land where dreams can thrive. It reminds us that no matter our struggles, we are free to stand tall, speak truth, and pursue a brighter future together. Let’s carry that spirit with us as we celebrate with our families.
            </p>

            <p>
                If Field Day left you wanting more, good news! MARC is hosting a Potluck POTA (Parks on the Air) event on Saturday, July 26th at Eisenhower State Park. You’ll find more details in this newsletter and at the July general meeting. One thing sets this event apart from Field Day – air conditioning! That’s right – we’ve reserved the group recreation center at the park, complete with A/C, a full kitchen, and indoor restrooms. We’ll bring our club go-kits, so you don’t need to worry about bringing equipment. Stay tuned for more info!
            </p>

            <p>
                In other news, our very own Bob Devance – K5CRX – hosted an Electronics 101 class at McKinney Fire Station #10 in June. It was a great success, with excellent attendance and an even better presentation. But wait – there’s more! On Saturday, July 12th, Bob will be teaching Electronics 101 – Part II. If you missed the first session, no problem – you can catch up on the MARC YouTube channel. Don’t miss this next class – it promises to be just as informative and engaging.
            </p>

            <p>
                And don’t forget – Texas summers get hot! Please remember to stay hydrated and use plenty of sunscreen while enjoying the summer vacation season. We want all our members and their families to stay safe during the hot summer.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thank you, as always, for being a MARC member. You help make our club a welcoming, vibrant community for everyone who shares a love for this amazing hobby.
            </p>

        <h2 class="section-header">👏 Volunteers Enjoy a Well-Deserved Treat</h2>
        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>
                Behind every great club are members who quietly keep things running. While reaching out to local businesses for gift card donations to support MARC giveaways and raffles, First Watch graciously contributed a special gift card - enough for eight people to enjoy an entrée and drink at their Hwy 380 location in McKinney.
            </p>

            <p>
                I recommended the card be given to the dedicated group of volunteers who maintain our Echolink system, monitor our club repeaters, and have worked closely with the Town of Fairview to plan and coordinate the installation of a new club repeater and supporting equipment on the town’s water tower. MARC is lucky to have such capable and committed members in our ranks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Everyone was able to align their schedules and gather for a relaxing, well-earned meal on June 26th. If you see them, take a moment to say thanks and maybe even ask how you can pitch in.
            </p>

            <p>
                We appreciate First Watch’s generosity; it was a thoughtful gesture that meant a lot. If you’re in the area, consider stopping by. You can check out their menu at <span class="hyperlink-light">firstwatch.com</span>

        <h2 class="section-header">📘 The First Electronics 101 Class Well-Attended</h2>
        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>
                The first MARC Electronics 101 class for 2025 convened at McKinney Fire Station # 10 on June 14th to tackle DC Circuits, the first lesson in the series with more to come. The 18 attendees explored the wonders of direct current, lamps, resistors, switches, breadboard wiring, Ohm’s Law, and use of the Volt-Ohm-Meter. All the classes in the Electronics series are “hands-on” and provide an opportunity for participants to get their hands dirty as they wire up circuits to demonstrate the principles studied. Fun learning was the order of the day.
            </p>

            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; gap: 20px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <img src="images/electronics-101-2.jpg" class="image-frame" style="max-width: 250px; height: auto;">
            </div>

            <p>
                The good mix of new and experienced hams worked especially well, allowing practiced hands to assist those who were hesitant to flip the power switch to see if the circuit really worked. MARC members are the greatest at pitching in to help each other and this class illustrates it vividly.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you were unable to attend or need a refresh, keep an eye on our YouTube channel for the video presentation to be posted soon.

            <p>
                There will be six classes in the series covering DC circuits, AC circuits, Solid State Devices, Vacuum Tubes, Digital Principles, and one wild card for a class or a project build.

    <article class="flowing-columns">
        <p>
            At the request of our members, MARC has added prizes for fox hunters—and the response has been fantastic. Several local businesses and club members have generously donated gift cards and other prizes to be used for hunts and future events.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lance – KM6LMP returned from Hamcation with a few great giveaways and donated them to the cause, while John – KC5JMD contributed a Yaesu cap he picked up in Dayton. Thanks to these thoughtful donations, successful fox hunters are now entered into a drawing for some fun and tasty rewards.
        </p>

        <p>
            Three lucky winners recently received a mix of items including a free appetizer from Fire Bowl or Piada’s Italian Street Food, queso from Torchy’s Tacos, dinner for two at IHOP, a free entrée at Texas Roadhouse, a $20 gift card to First Watch, a Yaesu cap, a mouse pad, and even a Subaru hat. MARC is grateful for the support of these businesses. Next time you're dining out—or buying a new car—consider showing them some appreciation.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you've never tried a fox hunt, they’re a blast. Robert – WZ5V built “Felicia the Fox,” and each Saturday morning a club member hides her somewhere in McKinney. Felicia transmits a signal every few minutes until Sunday evening, when she’s returned to her den for a recharge.
        </p>

        <p>
            Want to give it a try but not sure where to start? There are some great tutorials on YouTube—or you can email <span class="hyperlink">GeriKI5OEX@gmail.com</span>, and I’ll help connect you with an experienced hunter.

            </strong>

            <p>MARC maintains a chat group on groups.io to facilitate club communication between meetings and

                    class="hyperlink">https://groups.io/g/McKinneyARC</span>. Your application
                will be approved quickly.</p>

            <p>The purposes of the MARC email reflector are: 1) Facilitate the timely distribution of MARC
                information and news to club members. 2) Allow for the sharing of amateur radio related topics among
                club members. 3) Provide a forum for the discussion of amateur related information among club
                members. 4) Act as a marketplace for the buying and selling of amateur radio and computer equipment
                and services. Club members should utilize good judgment with regard to topics or content that are
                posted on the MARC reflector. To that end it is recommended that political and religious topics or
                content be avoided unless directly related to amateur radio. In addition, personal attacks in any
                form will not be tolerated.</p>
