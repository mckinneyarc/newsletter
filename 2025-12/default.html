        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>Hello MARC Family,</p>

            <p>I hope everyone enjoyed a wonderful Thanksgiving and made great memories with friends and family. Melinda
                and I were blessed to spend Thanksgiving week in the Philippines and Japan this year. It was another
                exciting trip filled with new experiences and we’re grateful to be back home in the comfort of familiar
                surroundings.</p>

            <p>A big thank-you goes out to Bob DeVance – K5CRX, Dave Power – KS5SK, and Mike Flusche – W5MEF for hosting
                another excellent class on operating modes. We’re already looking forward to the next in-person class,
                presented by Cliff Harden – KE5VXZ, on Soldering with a Battery Monitor Project. It will be held at
                McKinney Fire Station #5 on Saturday, December 13th at 9:00 AM. More information can be found on our
                Discord channel.</p>

            <p>This month brings our favorite holiday, Christmas! Let’s all remember that the true meaning of Christmas
                goes far beyond giving, receiving, and opening gifts. Speaking of gifts, you won’t want to miss our next
                club meeting, which also serves as the MARC Christmas Party! We’ll hold a brief business meeting
                followed by the celebration. As always, we’ll have a Yankee Swap / Dirty Santa gift exchange. Please
                bring a wrapped gift valued at approximately $25 if you’d like to participate. More details can be found
                in this newsletter.</p>

            <p>MARC is also proud to support Toys for Tots. If you’d like to contribute, please bring an unwrapped toy
                for a child to the Christmas Party.</p>

            <p>Don’t forget our Saturday morning breakfast at the McKinney IHOP (75 & 380)! Arrive around 7:00 AM to
                grab a seat, enjoy some pancakes and coffee, and catch up with fellow hams — it’s the perfect way to
                kick off your weekend.</p>

            <p class="signature">
                Merry Christmas and 73,<br>

        <h2 class="section-header">🎄 MARC Christmas Party & Gift Exchange</h2>
        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>MARC will host its annual Christmas Party with Gift Exchange on <strong>December 9</strong> at
                <strong>7:00 PM</strong> at Spring Creek Barbeque. This event has always been one of the most popular
                and well attended events that MARC supports.
            </p>

            <p>The club will be providing <strong>$500 worth of gifts</strong> for club members that will be awarded via
                a drawing. Following the drawings for club-provided gifts, the annual gift exchange will take front and
                center. This is a fun time with members selecting a gift, opening the selected gift, and perhaps having
                it taken by another member. Of course, if the gift is taken, he/she may take another gift that has been
                opened or select another gift from the pool of gifts.</p>

            <p>The board is recommending that a gift of approximately <strong>$25 in value</strong> be purchased,
                wrapped, and brought to the party where it will be placed on a table in front of all attendees for all
                to see. The board is encouraging that all participants bring a gift they would like to receive – in
                other words – no junk.</p>

            <p>Please note that the club-provided gifts are for club members in good standing only. If one does not want
                to participate in the gift exchange, he/she is still welcome at the Christmas Party but would simply not
                bring a gift for the exchange.</p>

            <h2>Christmas Gift Exchange Rules</h2>

            <ul class="padded-list">
                <li><strong>Each player who wishes to participate in the exchange brings one wrapped gift</strong>
                    (suggested value $25 – in other words, a gift you would like to receive) to contribute to a common
                    pool. If you elect not to participate, simply sit out the exchange and enjoy the show.</li>

                <li><strong>Each player will be provided a numbered ticket</strong> to determine the order in which
                    players will go.</li>

                <li><strong>The gift pool will be located at the front of the room</strong> for all to see.</li>

                <li><strong>Ticket numbers will be drawn randomly</strong> to determine order of gift selection. The
                    first player selects a gift from the pool and opens it. He/she should make sure everyone can see the
                    gift!</li>

                <li><strong>Subsequent players can choose</strong> to either pick an unwrapped gift from the pool or
                    take any previous player's gift. Anyone who gets their gift taken in this way can do the same –
                    choose a new gift from the pool or take one from someone else.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Limit on gift swapping:</strong> Three swaps and the gift is out. If a present is
                            taken three times (it is now in the hands of its fourth owner), it's out of the exchange and
                            the person who holds it gets to walk away with it unless the first player wants it at the
                            end of the exchange.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>After all players have had a turn,</strong> the first player gets a chance to swap the gift
                    he/she is holding for any other opened gift. Anyone who's gift is taken may swap gifts with someone
                    else (as long as that person hasn't been taken from yet). When someone declines to swap gifts, the
                    exchange comes to an end.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We look forward to celebrating the season with you at this festive event. Bring your holiday spirit, a
                great gift, and get ready for an evening of fellowship and fun!</p>

        <h2 class="section-header" style="color: white;">🎁 Marine Toys for Tots</h2>
        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>MARC is proud to support the Marine Corps' annual <strong>Toys for Tots</strong> drive. This program
                brings joy to children in need throughout our community during the holiday season, and we invite all
                members to participate in this worthy cause.</p>

            <p>At the Christmas Party on <strong>December 9</strong>, a collection box will be provided to receive
                <strong>new, unwrapped toys</strong>. These toys will be delivered to Toys for Tots for distribution to
                children who might otherwise go without gifts this Christmas.
            </p>

            <p>When selecting a toy to donate, consider items that would bring a smile to a child's face –
                age-appropriate toys, games, books, stuffed animals, sports equipment, or educational items are all
                excellent choices. Please ensure all toys are new and in their original packaging when possible.</p>

            <p>Your generosity helps make the holidays brighter for families in our community. Whether you bring one toy
                or several, every contribution makes a difference in a child's life. Together, we can spread holiday
                cheer and demonstrate the spirit of service that defines amateur radio and our club.</p>

            <p>Thank you in advance for your support of this important community program. Let's make this Christmas
                special for as many children as possible!</p>

            <h2>Presentation by Tim Valis KK5TIM</h2>
            <h3>Antenna Field Testing & Results Review</h3>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> Compare SWR and real-world performance of various portable antennas using FT8 and PSK
                Reporter.</p>

            <h3>1. Overview</h3>
            <ul class="padded-list">
                <li>Eight antennas were assembled and tested, including a Delta Loop, several verticals, POTA
                    Performers, the Chelegance MC-750, the MyGoTo antenna, a Radiodity antenna, the Ultimax, and a Yaesu
                    ATAS-120.</li>
                <li>The goal was to review SWR, deployment ease, and FT8 propagation results across all antennas.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Test Method</h3>
            <ul class="padded-list">
                <li>All antennas were measured on the 20-meter band using a RigExpert AA-230 analyzer.</li>
                <li>SWR was recorded at lower band edge, center, upper band edge, and lowest point.</li>
                <li>FT8 was used to transmit three CQ cycles per antenna over 90 seconds.</li>
                <li>PSK Reporter was used as the reverse beacon network to map how far each antenna was heard.</li>
                <li>A single radio, wattmeter, and antenna switch were used to ensure consistent testing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Key Findings</h3>
            <ul class="padded-list">
                <li>Most antennas had acceptable SWR and could operate without a tuner.</li>
                <li>Some antennas could not handle 100 W digital:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Radiodity, MyGoTo, and ATAS-120 needed power reduced to 25 W.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Several antennas reached Europe, Alaska, and Asia via FT8.</li>
                <li>Roger's POTA Performer achieved the farthest reach, including Japan.</li>
                <li>SWR quality did not always correlate with best propagation results.</li>
                <li>The Chelegance, Delta Loop, and well-tuned POTA Performers performed strongly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Issues Encountered</h3>
            <ul class="padded-list">
                <li>Misidentified and unlabeled cables caused confusion during antenna switching.</li>
                <li>Overpowering low-rated antennas caused temporary shutdowns but no damage.</li>
                <li>The ATAS-120 required extra ground radials and long auto-tune time.</li>
                <li>Wind affected at least one antenna (POTA Performer), requiring additional ballast.</li>
                <li>Some PSK Reporter logs were lost due to the 24-hour retention limit.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Observations</h3>
            <ul class="padded-list">
                <li>Deployment height and radial setup made noticeable performance differences.</li>
                <li>The recent solar disturbance (CME) reduced expected band conditions, yet antennas still achieved
                    global reach.</li>
                <li>Setup differences between two POTA Performers produced up to 50% difference in spots received.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>6. Lessons Learned</h3>
            <ul class="padded-list">
                <li>Label all cables at both ends before testing.</li>
                <li>Respect antenna power limits, especially with 100%-duty-cycle digital modes.</li>
                <li>Allow sufficient time for ATAS autotrim tuning.</li>
                <li>SWR is only one factor—tuning and deployment strongly influence performance.</li>
                <li>Take more photos for better documentation next time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>7. Future Plans</h3>
            <ul class="padded-list">
                <li>Another antenna comparison event is planned for spring.</li>
                <li>Additional refinements and a larger field layout may be used.</li>
                <li>Testing may continue during Winter Field Day.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2 class="section-header" style="color: white;">🎅 Holidays at the Heard + Santa's Elves on the Air</h2>
        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>The Heard Museum has reached out to MARC for assistance at the Holidays at the Heard event, December 12,
                13 and 14. The hours are 5:30pm to 9:00pm. We will monitor the transportation to and from the remote
                parking site, Puster Elementary School, 856 Stoddard Rd, Fairview, TX 75069.</p>

            <p>This will also give us the opportunity to be Ambassadors for Amateur Radio and our club. We will be
                highly visible to all those in attendance, time to put our best foot forward! And in the Christmas
                spirit we can engage with the public by offering children to talk to Santa's Elves via our Elves on the
                Air program!</p>

            <p>Please wear club or Amateur Radio-related shirts and hats and High visibility vests. We will be assisting
                in parking areas. Flashlights are also recommended as it will be evening into nighttime. Please bring a
                Handheld radio programmed to the club 146.740 repeater and club simplex frequency, 146.540. We will have
                a go box at the location.</p>

            <p>The Heard graciously provides space for our VE Sessions and space for our sister club, W5GWL,
                volunteering will be a wonderful opportunity to give back.</p>

            <p>A SignUp Genius will be going out via email and Discord.</p>

            <p>If you are only able to work a partial shift, note that in the comment section of the signup. Please park
                at the remote site and ride to the Heard if you signed up to work there.</p>

            <p>This is a great Holiday event, suitable for the whole family! The website for the event is:</p>
