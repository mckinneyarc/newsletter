        <h2 class="section-header">üé∏ Smiles Charity Concert Help!</h2>
        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>We have been asked again to help with traffic control at the Smiles Charity concert this year.  To the best of my memory this is the 10th year MARC has teamed up with Smiles Charity to benefit a deserving veteran and their family.   The event will be May 25th, Sunday of Memorial Day weekend.  We will start around 3:30 PM and wrap up around 8:00 PM.  Who is Smiles Charity you ask?</p>
    
            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    
            <p>Bringing the Community Together to Change the World One Home, One Family at a Time.</p>
    
            <p>Smiles Charity utilizes a unique fundraising concept of bringing the community together for a concert to provide mortgage-free homes for wounded veterans. Generous local and corporate businesses sponsor the annual concert event held over Memorial Day weekend in McKinney, TX. 100% of the net profits from the annual event are then donated to pay off mortgages for wounded veterans.</p>
    
            <p>In its first three years, Smiles Charity benefitted Habitat for Humanity and helped build three homes for three amazing McKinney families who are beating the odds and now living the dream of home ownership. In 2011, Smiles Charity was honored to partner with an organization to help fund the build of homes for severely wounded veterans. Since then, Smiles Charity has continued to support disabled veterans by providing a mortgage-free home each year.</p>
    
            <p>The results are tangible. Since 2008, 22 mortgage-free homes have been provided through the generous donations of our sponsors. Each year past recipients attend the event and are able to interact with the sponsors that have provided their homes. Sponsors can see first-hand how their contributions are making an impact. *</p>
    
            <p>This is a very worthwhile and rewarding opportunity to give back to our veterans and our community.  If you would like to know more or sign up contact me at <span class="hyperlink-light">w5kzjham@gmail.com</span>.  I will also ask for a show of hands of past participants at the next meeting so you will have the opportunity to ask them as well.</p>
