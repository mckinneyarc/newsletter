                As the old saying goes, ‚ÄúApril showers bring May flowers.‚Äù Fortunately, we stayed mostly dry during
                April‚Äôs Potluck POTA BBQ at Bonham State Park‚Äîand the event was a fantastic success! We shared delicious
                food, enjoyed great camaraderie, and celebrated several operators making their first HF contacts. Every
                outing is a learning opportunity, and we picked up a few tips to make the next event even better.
                Felicia the Fox also made an appearance, giving several members a fun challenge during her not-so-easy
                hunt.
            </p>
            <p>
                MARC was also proud to be part of the Heart of Melissa Spring Festival. Our booth drew interest from
                many attendees curious about amateur radio. A big thank-you goes to Lance, (KM6LMP), for organizing our
                presence and representing the club so well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that May is here and the weather is warming up, it's a great time to get outside and enjoy our hobby
                in the fresh air. A personal POTA (Parks on the Air) activation perfectly blends outdoor fun with
                amateur radio. My wife and I love weekend camping trips that include some on-air time from beautiful
                parks. If you‚Äôre thinking about your first POTA activation but feel unsure about going it alone, jump on
                our Discord server and ask for some company ‚Äî many of our members would be happy to join you and offer
                support.
            </p>
            <p>
                May also brings Memorial Day, a time to honor the brave service members who gave their lives for our
                country. In that spirit, MARC is proud to continue our partnership with the Smiles Charity, which
                provides mortgage-free homes for wounded veterans. We‚Äôll be assisting during their Boots & Bling event
                on Sunday, May 25th, headlined by 38 Special. If you're interested in volunteering, please reach out to
                Andy, W5KZJ. We‚Äôll share more details at our May general meeting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking ahead, Field Day is just around the corner in June! Our dedicated Field Day director, Michael
                (W5MEF), is already hard at work with preparations. Michael consistently delivers an excellent
                experience, and we‚Äôre excited to see strong participation this year ‚Äî especially from some of our newer
                operators. Field Day is a great time for the entire MARC family to come together for this
                ‚Äúnot-a-contest‚Äù event. Let‚Äôs aim to beat our previous records for contacts and points!
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you all for being part of MARC and helping make this club such a vibrant and supportive community.
                I look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming events!

        <h2 class="section-header">üé∏ Smiles Charity Concert Help!</h2>
        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>We have been asked again to help with traffic control at the Smiles Charity concert this year. To the
                best of my memory this is the 10th year MARC has teamed up with Smiles Charity to benefit a deserving
                veteran and their family. The event will be May 25th, Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. We will start
                around 3:30 PM and wrap up around 8:00 PM. Who is Smiles Charity you ask?</p>

            <h1>Our Mission</h1>

            <p>Bringing the Community Together to Change the World One Home, One Family at a Time.</p>

            <p>Smiles Charity utilizes a unique fundraising concept of bringing the community together for a concert to
                provide mortgage-free homes for wounded veterans. Generous local and corporate businesses sponsor the
                annual concert event held over Memorial Day weekend in McKinney, TX. 100% of the net profits from the
                annual event are then donated to pay off mortgages for wounded veterans.</p>

            <p>In its first three years, Smiles Charity benefitted Habitat for Humanity and helped build three homes for
                three amazing McKinney families who are beating the odds and now living the dream of home ownership. In
                2011, Smiles Charity was honored to partner with an organization to help fund the build of homes for
                severely wounded veterans. Since then, Smiles Charity has continued to support disabled veterans by
                providing a mortgage-free home each year.</p>

            <p>The results are tangible. Since 2008, 22 mortgage-free homes have been provided through the generous
                donations of our sponsors. Each year past recipients attend the event and are able to interact with the
                sponsors that have provided their homes. Sponsors can see first-hand how their contributions are making
                an impact. *</p>

            <p>This is a very worthwhile and rewarding opportunity to give back to our veterans and our community. If
                you would like to know more or sign up contact me at <span
                    class="hyperlink-light">w5kzjham@gmail.com</span>. I will also ask for a show of hands of past
                participants at the next meeting so you will have the opportunity to ask them as well.</p>

        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>
                MARC had a booth at the Heart of Melissa Spring Festival on 4/26. Our setup included our FTM-300 UHF/VHF
                go box and the new FTM-710 HF go kit, both set up and running, making contacts. Flyers from the ARRL
                were available for those interested, along with a couple of new MARC flyers‚Äîone covering the McKinney
                Amateur Radio Club with a link to our website, and another explaining the differences between FRS, CB,
                GMRS, and Ham radio.

            </div>

            <p>
                We had some great conversations with many members of the community. A few youth seemed interested as
                well. Many attendees mentioned they‚Äôre aware that sometimes normal communication systems stop working
                and are looking for solutions that don‚Äôt rely on the internet. We shared real-life scenarios where radio
                was the only option‚Äîsuch as hurricanes in North Carolina and Florida, and a recent short-term power,
                internet, and phone outage in the Berry Farms area of Melissa.

            <p>
                Geri brought her Arrow antenna to talk about fox hunting, which drew a few more people over to the
                booth. A big shout-out to Robert (WZ5V), Melinda (WZ5MEL), John (KI5VXP), David (KI5LPO), and Geri
                (KI5OEX) for being there to support and promote the club and ham radio.

        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>
                The McKinney Amateur Radio Club hosted a successful Potluck POTA BBQ at Bonham State Park on Saturday,
                April 19th, 2025. We gathered at Group Picnic Pavilion 2 with plenty of parking and restrooms nearby,
                making it an ideal location for a full day of fun, food, and radio.

            </div>

            <p>
                Attendees brought family, friends, radio gear, and of course, delicious food! A highlight of the day was
                a slow-smoked pork loin with BBQ fixings, which paired perfectly with the many potluck sides shared by
                members. The atmosphere was casual, friendly, and full of great conversation.

            </p>
            <p>
                The event was open to all operators and their families, encouraging members to bring spouses and
                children. Newcomers and guests interested in amateur radio were welcomed warmly. These community-focused
                events are a great way to introduce others to our hobby and showcase its relevance and fun.
            </p>
            <p>
                While Texas State Park entry fees were in effect, those with a State Parks Pass (or veterans) enjoyed
                free entry. If you're into POTA or camping, the pass is a great investment.
            </p>
            <p>
                For those with a bit of mic fright, this event provided a relaxed environment to get on the air and
                build confidence. Several members used this as a chance to practice making contacts and learning the
                ropes, perfect preparation for Field Day.
            </p>
            <p>
                A fun twist to the day was ‚ÄúFelicia the Fox,‚Äù who made an appearance and led several members on a
                light-hearted fox hunt challenge using their HTs on 433.500 MHz.

            </strong>

            <p>MARC maintains a chat group on groups.io to facilitate club communication between meetings and
                newsletters. Sign up for this service by visiting <span
                    class="hyperlink">https://groups.io/g/McKinneyARC</span>. Your application
                will be approved quickly.</p>

            <p>The purposes of the MARC email reflector are: 1) Facilitate the timely distribution of MARC
                information and news to club members. 2) Allow for the sharing of amateur radio related topics among
                club members. 3) Provide a forum for the discussion of amateur related information among club
                members. 4) Act as a marketplace for the buying and selling of amateur radio and computer equipment
                and services. Club members should utilize good judgment with regard to topics or content that are
                posted on the MARC reflector. To that end it is recommended that political and religious topics or
                content be avoided unless directly related to amateur radio. In addition, personal attacks in any
                form will not be tolerated.</p>
