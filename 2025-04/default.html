            </strong>

            <p>MARC maintains a chat group on groups.io to facilitate club communication between meetings and
                newsletters. Sign up for this service by visiting <span
                    class="hyperlink">https://groups.io/g/McKinneyARC</span>. Your application
                will be approved quickly.</p>

            <p>The purposes of the MARC email reflector are: 1) Facilitate the timely distribution of MARC
                information and news to club members. 2) Allow for the sharing of amateur radio related topics among
                club members. 3) Provide a forum for the discussion of amateur related information among club
                members. 4) Act as a marketplace for the buying and selling of amateur radio and computer equipment
                and services. Club members should utilize good judgment with regard to topics or content that are
                posted on the MARC reflector. To that end it is recommended that political and religious topics or
                content be avoided unless directly related to amateur radio. In addition, personal attacks in any
                form will not be tolerated.</p>
