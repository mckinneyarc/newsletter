            <p>
                Hello fellow MARC members!  
                With February behind us, we can finally look forward to the arrival of spring in just a few short weeks. For many of us, spring represents a time of refreshing and rejuvenation after being cooped up indoors during the colder months.
            </p>
            <p>
                Speaking of rejuvenation, we recently welcomed our two new youth coordinators, Rob Klein (NZ5E) and Janice Klein (NZ5W), at our last general meeting. They have hit the ground running, bringing fresh enthusiasm to our youth program. Their efforts aim to attract younger members to the amateur radio hobby, and we‚Äôre excited to see the program grow! If you‚Äôd like to get involved or share ideas, Rob and Janice would love to hear from you.
            </p>
            <p>
                A big thank you to Bill Vining (N5YZ) for organizing our participation in judging the Dallas Regional Science & Engineering Fair (DRSEF) and great appreciation for the members that participated. This event was an incredible opportunity to witness the dedication and creativity of hundreds of young students as they showcased their projects. You‚Äôll find more details about the science fair in this newsletter.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the weather warms, nature also wakes from hibernation‚Äîthat means Felicia the Fox will soon be making her return! She‚Äôll be hiding in McKinney from early Saturday mornings until late Sunday afternoons. Stay tuned to the fox-hunting channel on our Discord page for exact dates and times. Fox hunting is a fun and challenging amateur radio activity, so grab your gear and see if you can track her down!
            </p>
            <p>
                Warmer weather also means Field Day is on the horizon in June! A great way to prepare for Field Day is by joining our Potluck POTA Club Outing on Saturday, April 19th at Bonham State Park. Whether you‚Äôre new to POTA or looking to sharpen your HF contact skills, this is an event you won‚Äôt want to miss. Plus, family members are welcome! More details will be shared at the next general club meeting.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we gear up for spring, let‚Äôs also start thinking about our favorite fair-weather activities‚Äîboth personally and as a club. We‚Äôd love to hear about your next amateur radio project, so come chat with us over breakfast at IHOP on Saturday or join the conversation on our Discord server!
            </p>
            <p>
                I‚Äôm looking forward to an exciting season ahead!

        <h2 class="section-header">üé§ March Presenter - Erik Jacobsen, NQ5Z</h2>
        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>
                Erik Jacobsen, NQ5Z, has been a dedicated amateur radio operator since 1988. His passion for emergency communications has taken him across the globe, from serving in the USAF in Germany‚Äîwhere he operated under DA1JE and AFT7SP‚Äîto deploying for disaster recovery efforts, including Hurricane Hugo relief in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands in 1989, as well as emergency communications during the 1992 Chicago flood.
            </p>
            <p>
                A lifelong advocate for public service and preparedness, Erik is an active member of the ARRL, Collin County ARES, and has previously served with McHenry County ARES and Lake County RACES. His dedication to emergency communications and Skywarn underscores his commitment to helping communities stay connected when it matters most.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond emergency communications, Erik is involved in promoting amateur radio to the next generation. He has actively supported Jamboree on the Air (JOTA), running a station for scout troops and inspiring young operators to explore the world of radio. He is currently pursuing the Worked All States Award and enjoys operating on D-Star.
            </p>
            <p>
                A strong proponent of Morse code, Erik continues to enjoy CW operations and encourages newcomers to embrace its unique challenges and rewards. While he respects all aspects of amateur radio, he fondly recalls the teachings of his elmer, WB9CYI, who championed CW proficiency and its enduring value in the hobby.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether on the airwaves or mentoring new operators, Erik‚Äôs enthusiasm for amateur radio remains as strong as ever. Join us in welcoming him to share his experiences and insights at our upcoming meeting!

            </strong>

            <p>MARC maintains a chat group on groups.io to facilitate club communication between meetings and
                newsletters. Sign up for this service by visiting <span
                    class="hyperlink">https://groups.io/g/McKinneyARC</span>. Your application
                will be approved quickly.</p>

            <p>The purposes of the MARC email reflector are: 1) Facilitate the timely distribution of MARC
                information and news to club members. 2) Allow for the sharing of amateur radio related topics among
                club members. 3) Provide a forum for the discussion of amateur related information among club
                members. 4) Act as a marketplace for the buying and selling of amateur radio and computer equipment
                and services. Club members should utilize good judgment with regard to topics or content that are
                posted on the MARC reflector. To that end it is recommended that political and religious topics or
                content be avoided unless directly related to amateur radio. In addition, personal attacks in any
                form will not be tolerated.</p>
