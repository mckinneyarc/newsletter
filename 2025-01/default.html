        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>Thank you to everyone for electing me as your new President and thank you to the nominating committee for
                having the confidence in me to fulfill this very important role.</p>

            <p>I would like to thank the outgoing board members, David ‚Äì K5EEN, Larry ‚Äì KI5OEZ, Luis ‚Äì KI5QAX, and Roy ‚Äì
                KB4ROY for their service to the club, not only as board members, but also as dedicated MARC club members

            <p>As we get ready to welcome the new year, it's a wonderful time to pause and think about our hopes and
                what brings us joy. For me, amateur radio is not just a hobby; it‚Äôs a true passion that enriches my
                life. Being part of the McKinney Amateur Radio Club (MARC) is a great privilege. It connects me with a
                warm and supportive community that loves to share knowledge. MARC is not just a group of radio
                enthusiasts; it‚Äôs a lively fellowship where everyone, no matter their experience level, feels encouraged
                and valued. This welcoming spirit is what makes our club special, creating a perfect space for
                friendship and learning.</p>

            <p>Looking ahead to 2025, it‚Äôs important to celebrate what MARC has achieved over the years. Our members
                have worked together to build a culture of cooperation and creativity, helping our club thrive. As we
                think about the future, let‚Äôs come together to brainstorm ways to improve our outreach and educational
                efforts. There are so many exciting opportunities to explore, such as community service projects,
                workshops, social events, and educational programs. By harnessing the unique talents and ideas of our
                members, we can create an even more enriching experience for both seasoned operators and newcomers.</p>

            <p>I am truly excited about what lies ahead in 2025. Our passionate members have so many creative ideas, and
                I can't wait to see these concepts grow into real projects. Together, we can leave a lasting impact on
                the amateur radio world and ensure that MARC continues to be a source of excitement and innovation.
                Let‚Äôs embrace the new year with open minds and eager spirits, ready to make wonderful memories and

        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>
                William Newman, WL9N, is an accomplished amateur radio operator and seasoned emergency communications expert.
                With years of experience in both the <strong>Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES)</strong> and the
                <strong>Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service (RACES)</strong>, William has become a trusted leader in the
                field of emergency and disaster communications.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2009, William completed the <strong>U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Communications Unit Leader
                    (COML)</strong> coursework and was later certified by the State of Illinois as an
                <em>All-Hazards Type III Communications Unit Leader</em>. His expertise led him to the prestigious
                <strong>Emergency Management Institute (EMI)</strong> in Maryland, where he earned his
                <em>COML Instructor's Certification</em> in 2012.
            </p>
            <p>
                William‚Äôs HAM radio journey began with a passion for DXing and antenna experimentation. His original HF
                station was powered by an <strong>Icom 7700</strong> and a <strong>True Talk G5RV dipole antenna.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Since relocating to the Dallas-Fort Worth area, William has faced antenna restrictions but remains
                determined to find innovative solutions to stay active on the airwaves. Known for his love of traditional
                QSL card exchanges, he cherishes the connections made through HAM radio and always encourages operators to
                send cards the <strong>‚Äúold-fashioned way.‚Äù</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Join us as William shares his expertise on joining <strong>Texas State RACES</strong> and navigating the
                <strong>State Emergency Response</strong> process, providing invaluable insights into the critical role
                amateur radio plays in disaster preparedness and response.
            </p>

        <h2 class="section-header">üåê Mobile Public Service Deployment Committee (MPSDC) - End-of-Year Update</h2>
        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <h1>Committee Objectives</h1>
            <p>The committee reviewed the necessity of replacing the outgoing CSU trailer and concluded that a
                replacement was not needed.</p>
            <p>It also assessed the needs of the communities served, identifying events such as Oktoberfest, bike races,
                and other gatherings that require Base and HT UHF/VHF/Simplex communications.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the committee explored options for a new platform, emphasizing the importance of lighter
                weight kits to enhance portability and efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Summary of Activities</h2>
            <p>We started off the year with a club-approved decision to sell the MPSDC trailer. The trailer has been
                sold, and the funds are now in the club account.</p>
            <p>With no emergency equipment demands from local governments and ARES having a defined list for
                self-deployment, we focused on UHF/VHF and HF kits. These kits can be used by the club at various
                events.</p>

            <h2>UHF/VHF Portable Go Box</h2>
            <p>We developed a UHF/VHF portable go box consisting of a Yaesu FTM-300 dual-band radio, chosen partly for
                its digital capability with WiresX. The assembly includes:</p>
            <ul style="line-height: 2; margin-top: 10px;">
                <li>An onboard 20 Ah battery</li>
                <li>USB/voltmeter power & antenna port</li>
                <li>A dual-band antenna (external antenna option available)</li>
                <li>Anderson PowerPole connections for external power</li>
                <li>A charging port and a switch between battery and external power</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The radio is mounted using HDPE plastic for the radio mount and battery cover, all enclosed in an Apache
                3800 box.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>HF Portable Deployment Kit</h2>
            <p>Significant time was spent on the design and layout of a new HF box for deployment, club activities, and
                field day.</p>
            <p>The previous cases weighed 75 lbs and required two people to carry. Our goal was to limit the weight to
                no more than 35 lbs for easier portability.</p>

            <div
                style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; gap: 20px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <img src="images/picture2.png" class="image-frame" style="max-width: 150px; height: auto;">
                <img src="images/picture3.png" class="image-frame" style="max-width: 110px; height: auto;">
            </div>

            <p>The new design incorporates the FlexStack box system from Lowes. The cabinet box opens from the bottom
                and slides out of the way, while the roller box is used to store the battery, coax, headset, and other
                accessories, ensuring easy maneuverability.</p>

            <p>A Yaesu FT-710 transceiver was chosen for the HF rig, along with a sound mixer for multiple audio
                devices. Panel mounts allow connections on the back of the radio to remain accessible when the box is
                opened.</p>

            <h2>Prototype Design</h2>
            <p>The first working prototype includes a frame constructed with 2020 extruded aluminum to securely hold
                components in place and an HDPE front panel to provide a clean and polished appearance.</p>
            <p>The lower box is designed to house the battery, charger, power supply, headphones, remote keypad, remote
                PTT, and miscellaneous cables. The system is equipped with wheels and a handle to ensure easy
                portability.</p>

            <div
                style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; gap: 20px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <img src="images/picture4.png" class="image-frame" style="max-width: 170px; height: auto;">
                <img src="images/picture5.png" class="image-frame" style="max-width: 170px; height: auto;">
            </div>

            <h2>Connection Features</h2>
            <p>The kit includes the following connections:</p>
            <ul style="line-height: 2; margin-top: 10px;">
                <li>USB and USB 2.0 (printer style)</li>
                <li>CW key and remote keyer for voice memory and frequency selection</li>
                <li>Anderson PowerPole connections</li>
                <li>USB/voltmeter for phone charging</li>
                <li>Antenna connector</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The radio slides on frame rails to the front of the box, with the prototype weighing in at 32 lbs. The
                next step is selecting antennas to complete the kit.</p>

            <p>
            <div
                style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; gap: 20px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <img src="images/picture6.png" class="image-frame" style="max-width: 250px; height: auto;">
            </div>
            </p>

            The final unit is planned to be presented at the December Board of Directors meeting for review and
            approval.

            </strong>

            <p>MARC maintains a chat group on groups.io to facilitate club communication between meetings and
                newsletters. Sign up for this service by visiting <span
                    class="hyperlink">https://groups.io/g/McKinneyARC</span>. Your application
                will be approved quickly.</p>

            <p>The purposes of the MARC email reflector are: 1) Facilitate the timely distribution of MARC
                information and news to club members. 2) Allow for the sharing of amateur radio related topics among
                club members. 3) Provide a forum for the discussion of amateur related information among club
                members. 4) Act as a marketplace for the buying and selling of amateur radio and computer equipment
                and services. Club members should utilize good judgment with regard to topics or content that are
                posted on the MARC reflector. To that end it is recommended that political and religious topics or
                content be avoided unless directly related to amateur radio. In addition, personal attacks in any
                form will not be tolerated.</p>
