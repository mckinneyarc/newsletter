        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>Hello MARC Members!</p>

            <p>Happy New Year and welcome to 2026!</p>

            <p>I hope everyone enjoyed a wonderful Christmas and a safe, happy New Year. We have a lot to look forward to in the coming year with the McKinney Amateur Radio Club, including many exciting activities and events already on the calendar.</p>

            <p>Looking back at December, Clif Harden – KE5VXZ led an outstanding soldering class where participants built a battery monitor. Clif was joined by several dedicated club members, including Bob DeVance – K5CRX and Tim Valis – KK5TIM, who assisted with instruction and equipment. A special thank-you also goes to Geri Sudman – KI5OEX for coordinating and scheduling our activities, and to Lance Chapman – KM6LMP for recording and uploading videos so members can continue learning after the meetings. This is a great example of how our members consistently step up to make our educational programs successful.</p>

            <p>MARC's Christmas Party was another highlight of the month. Thanks to our entertaining MC duo, Bob DeVance – K5CRX and Lance Chapman – KM6LMP, the evening was filled with laughter and fun. The gift exchange and door prizes were a big hit, and the generosity shown by our members in support of the Toys for Tots campaign was truly inspiring.</p>

            <p>December also brought great success with our support of the Heard Museum during Holidays at the Heard, featuring our N5P special event station, "Elves on the Air." Our station attracted a lot of attention, and many excited kids lined up for the chance to talk on the radio with one of Santa's favorite elves.</p>

            <p>Looking ahead to January, one of our major activities will be Winter Field Day, taking place January 24–25. This year, MARC will be operating indoors in a climate-controlled environment, thanks to Lance Chapman – KM6LMP for securing the location. More details will be shared at our January general meeting and posted on our Discord server.</p>

            <p>We are always looking for additional Net Control Operators. Serving as an NCO can be both exciting and rewarding—and it's not as difficult as it may seem. We especially need volunteers for the Sunday Night Net on the repeater and the Monday Night Simplex Net, where we currently have a shortage. If you're interested, please reach out and we'll be happy to help you get started.</p>

            <p>Finally, don't forget our Saturday morning breakfast at the McKinney IHOP (75 & 380). Arrive around 7:00 AM to enjoy pancakes, coffee, and great conversation with fellow hams—it's a perfect way to start the weekend.</p>

            <p>We look forward to a fantastic year ahead with MARC!</p>

Both were remembered for their dedication and contributions to the club. Additionally, the club mourned the loss of Randy Davis (KF5ZKU) (December 8, 2025), a valued member known for his participation and warm presence. Their lives and service were honored, and condolences were extended to their families.</p>

            <h1>Welcome and Member Updates</h1>
            <p>New and returning guests were welcomed, including Joe and his wife Brenda. Jeff was introduced as a new member candidate, and his wife was also present. The club inquired about new licensees and call signs; Jeff was noted as working on an upgrade.</p>

            <h1>Approval of Previous Meeting Minutes</h1>
            <p>The minutes from the previous meeting, as published in the Mark newsletter, were motioned for approval by Kyri Calder (KG5WXZ) and seconded by Tim Valis (KK5TIM). The motion carried without opposition.</p>

            <h1>VE Coordinator Report</h1>
            <p>David Hampton (KI5LPO), the VE coordinator, reported one person (Ellis Thompson) tested at the session. David's efforts and the support of the volunteer examiners were acknowledged.</p>

            <h1>Treasurer's Report</h1>
            <p>The treasurer's report indicated a starting balance of $23,367.54, contributions totaling $288.00, and expenses just over $3.00, resulting in an ending balance of $23,652.18. Members were invited to ask questions; the club maintains transparency in financial matters.</p>

            <h1>Repeater Update</h1>
            <p>Ron provided updates on repeater projects, highlighting progress at Fairview and ongoing coordination with town officials. He noted the recent loss of Brian Belcher, who was instrumental in establishing the club's repeater infrastructure. Developments in Melissa include a city-mandated maintenance project requiring temporary relocation of antennas, with efforts underway to negotiate logistics and costs. Other repeater sites, including 75/380 and Custer/Virginia, were briefly discussed.</p>

            <h1>Acknowledgment of Club Volunteers</h1>
            <p>Robert expressed gratitude to Ron and all volunteers supporting technical operations, including Dick Price, Dave Pekarsky, Sid, and Luis. Their expertise and dedication were deeply appreciated.</p>

            <h1>Fox Hunting Activities</h1>
            <p>Despite Felicia being under the weather, Steve and Marco were active in fox hunting. Members were encouraged to participate in this fun and challenging activity.</p>

            <h1>Soldering Class Announcement</h1>
            <p>A soldering class will be held at Fire Station #5 (6600 Virginia Parkway) on Saturday at 9 AM, led by Cliff (KE5VXZ) and supported by Bob DeVance (K5CRX). Members were encouraged to bring soldering tools, wire cutters, solder, and flux if available, as well as helping hands (circuit board stands). Information is also available on Discord.</p>

            <h1>Elves on the Air & Holiday Events</h1>
            <p>Mike announced the "Elves on the Air" event starting tomorrow night, inviting members and their families to participate in on-air holiday activities using the special call sign November 5 Papa (North 5 Pole). Volunteers are needed for the "Holidays at the Herd" event (Friday–Sunday), assisting with shuttle bus monitoring and facilitating radio communication for children with "elves." Members were urged to sign up via Discord or provided links, wear club apparel and high-visibility vests, and be prepared for outdoor conditions. The club values this opportunity to give back, as the Herd Museum has supported club VE sessions for years.</p>

            <h1>Adjournment</h1>
            <p>The meeting continued with further announcements and concluded with gratitude to all attendees and volunteers. Motion made to adjourn by Mike Flusche (W5MEF), second by Larry Land (KI5OEX). Motion carried.</p>

        <h2 class="section-header">📚 MARC General License Class</h2>
        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>A General License prep class will be offered on Thursday evenings from January 8 to February 12 to assist in
                preparation for MARC's testing session on Heard Museum in February 15. The one-hour classes will be
                presented on Zoom from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM each Thursday.</p>
    
            <p>The class will cover the technical portions of the exam. The sections on rules, regulations, and operation
                will not be covered in this class. There are several on-line exam prep and review options available – many
                for free. These on-line programs are very useful for reviewing the rules portions of the Exam as well as all
                the other questions in the question pool.</p>
    
            <p>The purpose of this class is to help hams get a better grasp of the technical sections of the Exam. There
                will be time for discussion of technical details related to the Exam questions. The General Exam requires 26
                of 35 questions from a pool of 450 questions. 26 correct answers is the passing score.</p>
    
            <p>Some of the topics to be covered are antennas & feed lines, digital electronics, Ohm's Law, electronic
                components, and question-based circuit analysis. We will be using the PowerPoint slide deck from Gordon
                West, W6BNO and the W5YI group. This deck follows West's General Class book. We will also reference the ARRL
                General Class book as well. I recommend either book as a great study reference.</p>
    
            <p>The course is free.</p>
    
            <p>The Zoom link is: <a class="hyperlink" href="https://us06web.zoom.us/j/88593241933" target="_blank"

                The passcode is: <strong>517140</strong>

        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>MARC's December 13th soldering class at Fire Station #5 was a tremendous success! Led by Cliff Harden - KE5VXZ, with expert assistance from Bob DeVance - K5CRX, members gained hands-on experience building functional 12V battery monitor devices from scratch.</p>

            <img src="images/soldering-1.jpg" style="width:250px; display: block; margin: auto; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            
            <img src="images/soldering-2.jpg" style="width:250px; display: block; margin: auto; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <p>Participants learned the basics of proper soldering technique, including the differences between solder types, proper temperature control, and professional methods for creating reliable connections. Members brought their own soldering irons, wire cutters, solder, and flux, while the club provided helping hands (circuit board stands) for those who needed them. Everyone walked away with a completed battery monitor project and newfound confidence in their soldering abilities.</p>

            <p>A heartfelt thank you to all the Elmers who make these educational sessions possible. Your patience, knowledge, and dedication to mentoring fellow members are invaluable to our club's mission of continuous learning and skill development!</p>

            </strong>

            <p>MARC maintains a chat group on groups.io to facilitate club communication between meetings and
                newsletters. Sign up for this service by visiting <span
                    class="hyperlink">https://groups.io/g/McKinneyARC</span>. Your application
                will be approved quickly.</p>

            <p>The purposes of the MARC email reflector are: 1) Facilitate the timely distribution of MARC
                information and news to club members. 2) Allow for the sharing of amateur radio related topics among
                club members. 3) Provide a forum for the discussion of amateur related information among club
                members. 4) Act as a marketplace for the buying and selling of amateur radio and computer equipment
                and services. Club members should utilize good judgment with regard to topics or content that are
                posted on the MARC reflector. To that end it is recommended that political and religious topics or
                content be avoided unless directly related to amateur radio. In addition, personal attacks in any
                form will not be tolerated.</p>
