        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>October is here!  That means cooler air, pumpkin spice in everything, and kids knocking at your door dressed as superheroes, princesses, and the occasional miniature zombie.  So, grab a latte (pumpkin optional), hand out some Halloween candy, and enjoy the season.</p>

            <p>September was a fantastic month for the McKinney Oktoberfest celebration, and MARC was right in the middle of the fun.  A huge shout-out to Sid Gibson ‚Äì K5DKW for coordinating MARC‚Äôs participation.  Great appreciation goes to our volunteers who represented not just the club, but the entire amateur radio hobby, with knowledge, enthusiasm, and professionalism.  You all made MARC look great, and we‚Äôre already looking forward to next year!</p>

            <p>Our very own Bob DeVance ‚Äì K5CRX is back at it with another hands-on class: Electronics 101 Part IV ‚Äì Digital Electronics.  Mark your calendars for Saturday, October 4th, at 9:00 AM at McKinney Fire Station #10.  If you‚Äôve been to Bob‚Äôs classes before, you know they‚Äôre packed with useful knowledge, practical tips, and the occasional ‚Äúah-ha‚Äù moment.  Details are posted on the MARC Discord.  If you‚Äôre not already in there, this is your chance to join the fun (and catch a few entertaining posts along the way).</p>

            <p>Fall weather means fox hunting is officially in its prime!  Haven‚Äôt tried it yet?  Now‚Äôs the perfect time to grab an antenna, load the family into the car, and go find our elusive foxes, Felicia (433.500) and Steve (433.750).  They‚Äôre most active on weekends, and the best part is: you don‚Äôt even need a license to join the chase!  It‚Äôs part radio science, part scavenger hunt, and a whole lot of fun.</p>

            <p>Sleep in on Saturday?  Not if you‚Äôre a ham!  Every Saturday morning, MARC gathers at the IHOP in McKinney (75 &amp; 380).  Show up around 7:00 AM to snag a good seat and enjoy the company of fellow hams.  There‚Äôs nothing like pancakes, coffee, and good conversation to start the weekend off right.</p>

            <p>Here‚Äôs to a great October filled with radios, foxes, and maybe just a little too much candy.</p>

    <h2 class="section-header">üìú Proposed Bylaws Amendment ‚Äì Communications Director Technical Assistants</h2>

    <article class="flowing-columns">

        <p>The MARC membership is being asked to consider a proposed amendment to Section 10, Paragraph 3 
        of the bylaws. The purpose of this change is to allow the Communications Director to appoint 
        additional Technical Assistants as needed, beyond the current limit of two. This amendment was 
        introduced at the September General Meeting and will be brought to a vote at the October General Meeting.</p>

        <h2>Current Bylaw Language</h2>
        <blockquote>
            The Communications Director can request two (2) Technical Assistants for the maintenance of the Club repeaters, antennas, and other radio equipment. As in the case of the Communications Director, the nominating committee will also qualify these members. In the interest of technical continuity, the terms of these positions should overlap.
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Motion</h2>
        <p>At the September meeting, the following motion was introduced:</p>
        <blockquote>
            ‚ÄúI make a motion that we strike the number two (2) and leave the rest of it as is.‚Äù
        </blockquote>
        <p>The motion was made by <strong>Dave Piekarski (K5EEN)</strong>, tabled in accordance with procedure, and is published here for membership review prior to the October vote.</p>

        <h2>Proposed Bylaw Language</h2>
        <blockquote>
            The Communications Director can request Technical Assistants for the maintenance of the Club repeaters, antennas, and other radio equipment. As in the case of the Communications Director, the nominating committee will also qualify these members. In the interest of technical continuity, the terms of these positions should overlap.
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Rationale</h2>
        <p>When the bylaws were adopted, MARC maintained only a single 2-meter repeater. Today, the club oversees 
        a far more complex infrastructure, including:</p>
        <ul class="padded-list">
            <li>Two 2-meter repeaters (analog and digital)</li>
            <li>One 70cm repeater (analog and digital)</li>
            <li>WiresX and EchoLink gateways</li>
            <li>Two APRS digipeaters</li>
            <li>Four repeater sites (75/380, Custer/Virginia, Melissa, and New Hope)</li>
            <li>Construction underway for a second 70cm DMR repeater with microwave video link in Fairview</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This scale and complexity requires more resources than originally anticipated. Removing the numerical limit 
        allows the Communications Director to appoint Technical Assistants with specific expertise across MARC‚Äôs 
        integrated infrastructure.</p>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>The amendment will be voted on at the October General Meeting. A simple majority of eligible voting members present is required for approval. Members are encouraged to review the proposed change and rationale in advance.</p>

            </strong>

            <p>MARC maintains a chat group on groups.io to facilitate club communication between meetings and
                newsletters. Sign up for this service by visiting <span
                    class="hyperlink">https://groups.io/g/McKinneyARC</span>. Your application
                will be approved quickly.</p>

            <p>The purposes of the MARC email reflector are: 1) Facilitate the timely distribution of MARC
                information and news to club members. 2) Allow for the sharing of amateur radio related topics among
                club members. 3) Provide a forum for the discussion of amateur related information among club
                members. 4) Act as a marketplace for the buying and selling of amateur radio and computer equipment
                and services. Club members should utilize good judgment with regard to topics or content that are
                posted on the MARC reflector. To that end it is recommended that political and religious topics or
                content be avoided unless directly related to amateur radio. In addition, personal attacks in any
                form will not be tolerated.</p>
