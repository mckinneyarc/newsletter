        <h2 class="section-header">üì¢ President's Message</h2>
        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>Welcome to September! I hope everyone enjoyed their Labor Day weekend. Labor Day is our annual salute to
                the contributions, ingenuity, and grit of the American workforce. If you‚Äôre a parent of school-aged
                kids, you may also be celebrating something else ‚Äî their return to school! (Suddenly, coffee tastes
                sweeter and mornings feel a little quieter, right?)</p>

            <p>Speaking of ingenuity and back-to-school spirit, a big shout-out to Bob DeVance ‚Äî K5CRX, who held two
                fantastic electronics classes in August. I had the pleasure of attending both, and let me tell you, they
                were top-notch with plenty of hands-on learning. Thank you, Bob, for sharing your time and knowledge
                with us! If you missed them, I highly recommend jumping in on the next round.</p>

            <p>Now, September doesn‚Äôt just mean cooler weather, it also means Oktoberfest! For the past several years,
                MARC has provided parking assistance and hosted a booth at the McKinney Oktoberfest Festival, and we‚Äôll
                be back again this year. The event runs September 26th‚Äì28th in downtown McKinney, and we‚Äôll need plenty
                of volunteers. Details will be shared at the general meeting and via a sign-up email, so dust off your
                lederhosen (optional) and come help out!</p>

            <p>Another September favorite is the Plano Balloon Festival on September 18th‚Äì21st. Fingers crossed for good
                weather and spectacular launches. On the topic of balloons, several MARC members recently attended a
                high-altitude balloon launch in Celina on August 23rd, hosted by the Richardson Wireless Klub. The
                balloon soared over 105,000 feet before bursting and rapidly descending back to Earth. The photos it
                sent of our beautiful planet were absolutely stunning.</p>

            <p>With the weather turning mild, it‚Äôs the perfect season to get out and do some fox hunting, and no, not
                the furry kind. We‚Äôre talking about amateur radio foxes! We‚Äôre excited to introduce a new fox to our
                skulk (yes, that‚Äôs the real term for a group of foxes). Meet ‚ÄúSteve,‚Äù designed by John Donovan ‚Äî KC5JMD.
                Alongside Felicia, Steve has also been hiding out on UHF each weekend, waiting to be found. The best
                part? You don‚Äôt even need a license to join the hunt, so grab your family and come enjoy the chase! More
                details are available on the MARC Discord server.</p>

            <p>I look forward to seeing everyone at our general meeting and Saturday morning breakfasts. Sure, it‚Äôs
                early on a Saturday, but trust me, it‚Äôs way more fun than sleeping in!</p>

                and provides 40-50secs of message, which includes a CW preamble and closing with some audio content
                in-between. His normal operating hours are Saturday 0700 to 2000 and Sunday 0700 to 1800-ish ‚Äì weather
                permitting. A slight drizzle won‚Äôt bother him, but much more than that and he‚Äôll have to come in from
                the
                rain. Any changes to the schedule will be posted in the MARC Discord::foxhunt channel.
            </p>

            <p>
                You will normally find Steve in western McKinney or eastern Prosper, although he may wander elsewhere
                within
                the McKinney boundaries, where you‚Äôll normally find Felicia. There‚Äôs plenty of room for both.
            </p>
            <p>
                For those that are interested in what‚Äôs in the box ‚Äì Steve is powered by a Raspberry Pi single-board
                computer with RealTimeClock module and home-brew interface board that provides connections to a
                QuanSheng
                UVK5 hand-held. RF output is currently set to ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù (2.0-2.5w) and the whole thing is powered by a
                20Ah
                LiFePO4 battery, so he has plenty of reserve. We may decide to change the RF output at a later time, but
                for
                now my preference is to be sure that he can be heard over a wider area.
            </p>

            <p>
                Like Felicia, Steve is enclosed in a green ‚Äòammo box‚Äô displaying a QR code for you to scan, directing
                you to
                our Fox Log Entry page ‚Äì where you‚Äôll record your name, callsign, and other information. Be sure to
                leave a
                comment on how you found the hunt ‚Ä¶ but don‚Äôt give away too many clues.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our logging application keeps track of everyone that successfully finds each Fox and we map all of the
                locations our Foxes have been placed (after the hunt has been closed). The map is at
                <a href="https://kc5jmd.net/fox-manager-map-w5mrc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                    <span class="hyperlink">https://kc5jmd.net/fox-manager-map-w5mrc/</span>
                </a>
                Felicia is indicated with red markers, Steve with green. Click on the markers for more information on
                the
                hunt.

            <p>
                We hope you take the time to get out and hunt these Foxes ‚Äì both Felicia (433.500) and Steve (433.750)
                on
                the weekends. The FoxMasters do our very best to ensure the Foxes are out in the field every weekend and
                hope you make good use of them. We‚Äôd love to hear your stories from the hunt or any suggestions you have
                for
                making the experience even better. Feel free to share them on the MARC Discord::foxhunt channel.

        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Doug KI5QED, and I am writing this for the purpose of helping fellow Hams with a
                common
                problem we all have. Not enough time to spend with our radio at home! As we see the median age of Ham
                Radio
                operators trending down, it is a very exciting thing to watch! However, most younger operators have
                regular
                jobs we must all attend these days, must keep that radio money coming in! So, the availability of
                spending
                time in front of our rigs at home is preciously small from day to day. The software I will be describing
                in
                this article is designed for this specific problem! Remote transmissions are not a new thing to Ham
                Radio;
                stations have had this same need since the beginning of Amateur Radio! What I have found makes the
                process a
                bit easier, and the experience more enjoyable!
            </p>

            <p>
                I live in Princeton but work in Little Elm. The dealership I work for is very understanding about my
                passion
                for Ham Radio. I have an Allstar radio-less node on my desk with an ethernet cable for connection! That
                allows me the opportunity to connect around the world on many repeaters and hub networks.
            </p>

                style="width:300px; display: block; margin: auto; margin-top: 20px;">

            <p>
                But I still found myself in need of access to my home shack to monitor local frequencies I have found.
                The
                Remote TX software gave me this ability! For more information on this, you can visit <span
                    class="hyperlink-light">https://remotetx.net</span>
            </p>

            <img src="images/featured-article-2.png"
                style="width:300px; display: block; margin: auto; margin-top: 20px;">

            <p>
                So, how to remote in was the question I started with. And I will be honest; the answers were more
                confusing
                than the problem! I knew I would have to have something on the radio I could log into for radio control.
                A
                raspberry Pi would be the right thing, but how to control that is where the real confusion started!
                There
                are many ways to get into that machine and make it work for you, and if you are knowledgeable with
                programming I am told it is not too hard to get done. That was just not the best scenario for my taste.
                Remote TX has made the process as streamlined as possible. You get a raspberry Pi, burn a customized
                image
                onto the SD card, and hook it up to your radio with a simple USB cord! Sounds simple, but during my
                setup I
                found a few things were not as planned at my shack!
            </p>

            <p>
                Security was a big problem I had to address early on! I wanted a system that only I could log into. And
                while that was possible with a home brew system, my confidence level was not well placed with that
                option.
                Remote TX provides all the cloud server security, and an easy path for me with encryption to access my
                radio! After resizing the pathway for everything in my shack, I found the setup process to be as easy as
                described on the website! I signed up for the thirty-day free trial and when I got the email that my
                account
                was ready, I downloaded the Balena Etcher software, customized my image with my callsign, and burned the
                image on the micro-SD card very quickly! After booting up the Pi, and hooking it up to the radio, I
                logged
                into the webpage and there we were!
            </p>

            <img src="images/featured-article-3.png"
                style="width:300px; display: block; margin: auto; margin-top: 20px;">
            <img src="images/featured-article-4.png"
                style="width:300px; display: block; margin: auto; margin-top: 4px;">

            <p>
                The remote software does not allow for a waterfall display on my Yeasu 991A, but several of the Icom
                radios
                do offer that. With the software, I can do anything with my radio otherwise. I can switch bands, and
                tune,
                as well and repeater encoding just as if I were there in front of my shack radio! The webpage software
                uses
                your speakers and microphone, and I have had success using my iPad with a Bluetooth earbud. There are
                several settings you need to configure to get this working. The website has plenty of quick start guides
                that help with these depending on your radio choice! This was the biggest problem I faced, but customer
                service through email with Remote TX was wonderful! They had me figured out and up and running in no
                time!
                You may also try the trucker‚Äôs Bluetooth with a microphone that wraps around to the mouth, it will be
                something I try in the next few days to see how the sound is best produced!
            </p>

            <p>
                Just to make you aware, there is of course a cost involved with this service. As of writing this it is
                only
                $70/yr. they do offer a $40/ 6mo as well, if you‚Äôre just looking to feel it out. Something I am doing
                with
                the thirty-day free trial! I will be purchasing the software for at least a year to see how much I use
                it.
                But I have the feeling it will be a permanent tool I keep on hand!
            </p>

            <p>73‚Äôs and Best Wishes!

            </strong>

            <p>MARC maintains a chat group on groups.io to facilitate club communication between meetings and
                newsletters. Sign up for this service by visiting <span
                    class="hyperlink">https://groups.io/g/McKinneyARC</span>. Your application
                will be approved quickly.</p>

            <p>The purposes of the MARC email reflector are: 1) Facilitate the timely distribution of MARC
                information and news to club members. 2) Allow for the sharing of amateur radio related topics among
                club members. 3) Provide a forum for the discussion of amateur related information among club
                members. 4) Act as a marketplace for the buying and selling of amateur radio and computer equipment
                and services. Club members should utilize good judgment with regard to topics or content that are
                posted on the MARC reflector. To that end it is recommended that political and religious topics or
                content be avoided unless directly related to amateur radio. In addition, personal attacks in any
                form will not be tolerated.</p>
