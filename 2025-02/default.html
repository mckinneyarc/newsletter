        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <h1>A Fresh Start for Our Valued Members!</h1>
            <p>We‚Äôre excited to announce a new initiative from the Board of Directors designed to reconnect with members who‚Äôve been away. Membership QRZ is a special program aimed at making it easier than ever to renew your connection with our club‚Äîregardless of how much time has passed.</p>
            
            <h1>What Is Membership QRZ?</h1>
            <p>Membership QRZ allows members who have not renewed their membership for a year or more to rejoin without needing to cover past dues. This means you can reestablish your place in our vibrant community with ease, focusing on what truly matters: engaging with fellow members, enjoying club benefits, and contributing to our shared mission.</p>
    
            <h1>Why Are We Doing This?</h1>
            <p>Our club thrives on the passion and involvement of its members. We recognize that circumstances may sometimes lead to a pause in membership. With Membership QRZ, we want to remove any obstacles and warmly invite everyone back. By simplifying the renewal process, we‚Äôre fostering inclusivity and encouraging the return of valued members who bring diverse perspectives and energy to our organization.</p>
            <p>Your membership dues play a vital role in keeping our club strong. They enable us to take on new and exciting projects, expand our outreach efforts, and continue making a positive impact in our community. By renewing your membership, you are directly contributing to the growth and sustainability of our shared mission.</p>
    
            <h1>How Does It Work?</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> The program is available to any member who has not renewed their membership for at least one year.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Renewal Process:</strong> Contact our club secretary at <span class="hyperlink-light">secretary@mckinneyarc.org</span> for more information.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>No Past Dues:</strong> Renew your membership at the current annual rate, and you‚Äôll be reinstated as a full member in good standing.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h1>Act Now and Reconnect!</h1>
            <p>Membership QRZ is our way of saying, ‚ÄúWelcome back!‚Äù Whether you‚Äôve been away for one year or several, we‚Äôre excited to have you rejoin our community. Don‚Äôt miss this opportunity to renew your membership and rediscover everything our club has to offer.</p>
            <p>For more details or to renew, contact <span class="hyperlink-light">secretary@mckinneyarc.org</span>. Let‚Äôs make 2025 a year of reconnection and growth together!</p>

        <h2 class="section-header">üì° Pre-Programmed Radios Initiative</h2>
        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>At the Oktoberfest celebration, McKinney club members discovered public interest in accessing emergency information via ham radio without requiring a license. In response, several club members are exploring ways to provide pre-programmed radios as a community service.</p>
            
            <h1>Pre-Programmed Radios</h1>
            <p>Tim (KK5TIM) noted that the club already has the necessary software and programming cables for multiple radio models. Joe (KJ5VYB) demonstrated this by programming a radio for a friend, providing an initial frequency list, disabling duplex to prevent unintentional transmissions, and suggesting programming radios at monthly sidewalk sales.</p>
            
            <h1>GMRS and FRS Opportunities</h1>
            <p>Peter (KJ5FJQ), Lance (KM6LMP), and Todd (KJ5INP) highlighted neighborhood interest in building a GMRS network. GMRS and FRS are seen as valuable tools for improving community communication. GMRS requires a license (no test needed) and covers the licensee's immediate family, serving as a gateway to ham radio for many.</p>

            <h1>Education and Community Engagement</h1>
            <p>Peter proposed educational initiatives to help individuals and neighborhoods understand emergency communication. Suggested topics include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Differences between ham, GMRS, FRS, and CB radio</li>
                <li>Understanding repeaters</li>
                <li>Operating handheld transceivers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Bob (K5CRX) shared his HT class materials to support this effort.</p>
            
            <h1>Pre-Assembled Radio Kits</h1>
            <p>Geri (KI5OEX) has created sample ready-to-listen radio kits to simplify purchasing for newcomers. She assembled three kits using Baofeng K5-Plus tri-band radios, which display city names instead of frequencies. These radios are pre-programmed with UHF/VHF Skywarn repeaters, air bands, and GMRS/FRS channels.</p>

            <p>Each kit includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pre-programmed radio with battery</li>
                <li>Signal stick antenna</li>
                <li>Earpiece, wrist lanyard, charging dock, and USB-C cable</li>
                <li>Laminated startup instructions, radio guide, and programming list</li>
                <li>Packaged in an Apache 1800 case</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Future Goals</h1>            
            <p>The goal is to develop a replicable program for McKinney ARC, enabling neighborhoods to become "radio-ready" for emergencies. This is more a premium option and an example of what we could provide. Plans have not been finalized.</p>

            <p>The purposes of the MARC email reflector are: 1) Facilitate the timely distribution of MARC
                information and news to club members. 2) Allow for the sharing of amateur radio related topics among
                club members. 3) Provide a forum for the discussion of amateur related information among club
                members. 4) Act as a marketplace for the buying and selling of amateur radio and computer equipment
                and services. Club members should utilize good judgment with regard to topics or content that are
                posted on the MARC reflector. To that end it is recommended that political and religious topics or
                content be avoided unless directly related to amateur radio. In addition, personal attacks in any
