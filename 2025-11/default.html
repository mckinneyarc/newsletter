        <h2 class="section-header">📢 President's Message</h2>
        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>Welcome to November!</p>

            <p>October was an exciting and busy month for us! A big shoutout to Bob DeVance – K5CRX for hosting an
                excellent and informative class on digital electronics. We also had a fantastic time at the MARC Potluck
                POTA BBQ at Bonham State Park. Many members came out to join the fun, along with several Scouts who
                participated in fox hunting and made on-air contacts during Jamboree On The Air.</p>

            <p>A special thank-you goes to Lance Chapman – KM6LMP, Joe Leeper – KJ5BYV, and Kyri Calder – KG5WXZ for
                helping the Scouts get on the air and track down those hidden foxes!</p>

            <p>As we move into November, cooler weather, a major holiday, and Election Day are all on the horizon. Be
                sure to get out and cast your vote. Voting is an important part of our civic duty. Speaking of voting,
                we'll also be holding club officer elections at this month's MARC general meeting. Check out more details
                about the election in this newsletter.</p>

            <p>Thanksgiving is one of our favorite times of the year. This is a chance to gather with family and friends,
                reflect on our blessings, and appreciate our wonderful hobby and the camaraderie within MARC. While
                you're celebrating, consider showing your friends and family a bit of what makes amateur radio so special.
                You might just spark some curiosity and inspire a new operator!</p>

            <p>If you have guests in town, take them out for a fox hunt! We now have three active foxes—Felicia, Steve,
                and our newest addition, Marco, who can be found in the Melissa area. Marco was created by Todd Bachli –
                KJ5INP. For the latest fox hunting updates, check out the fox hunting channel on our Discord server.</p>

            <p>If thinking about Thanksgiving has you craving some good food, we have great news! On Wednesday, November
                12th, from 4–8 PM, Chipotle in McKinney (2014 W University Dr) is hosting a fundraiser for MARC. You'll
                find more details in this newsletter.</p>

            <p>Of course, we can't forget our Saturday morning tradition. Breakfast at IHOP in McKinney (75 &amp; 380).
                Arrive around 7:00 AM to grab a seat, enjoy some pancakes and coffee, and catch up with fellow hams. It's
                the perfect way to start your weekend!</p>

            <p>Here's to a wonderful November filled with good food, family, friendship, and radio fun.</p>

        <h2 class="section-header">🗳️ Voting Procedures for 2026 Election of Board of Directors</h2>
        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>Since we only have elections once per year, we thought it would be a good idea to remind everyone of
                the procedures and processes for the conduct of the Board of Directors election. The MARC Constitution
                and By-Laws have some specific rules and processes that must be followed:</p>

            <p><strong>Eligibility to Vote</strong> – To be eligible to vote in the election, you must be an active
                member of the club (i.e. dues are current) and must have attended at least one regular meeting either
                in-person, via Zoom, or by Proxy within the six months preceding the election. This is one of the
                reasons why we try to be so careful about recording attendance at our regular meetings.</p>

            <p><strong>Voting by Proxy</strong> – If you are eligible to vote, but cannot attend the November meeting
                either in person or via Zoom, you can assign your Proxy to another eligible voting member to cast your
                vote for you. To do this, you will need to send an email to Lance Chapman, KM6LMP stating that you want to
                assign your Proxy to another eligible voting member. In your email, you will need to identify the
                eligible voting member to whom you will be assigning your Proxy. Be sure that you have also notified
                the person to whom you are assigning your Proxy so they will know that they will be casting your vote
                along with their own. It is important to note, that no eligible voting member may cast more than two
                Proxy votes in addition to their own.</p>

            <p><strong>Nominations</strong> – The Nominating Committee will be presenting their nominations for Board
                positions at the beginning of the voting process. You can see who they are recommending before the
                meeting by reviewing the sample ballot that is contained within this edition of the newsletter. During
                the meeting, the President will also call for any further nominations to come from the floor. If you
                want to run for a position, or if you want to nominate someone else for a position, this will be the
                time to do so. Nominations from the floor will require a second and a vote of the membership to place
                the nominee on the ballot.</p>

            <p><strong>Voting</strong> – Eligible voting members physically in attendance will be able to cast their
                vote and any Proxy votes they are carrying during the meeting. For those attending via Zoom, we will
                set up a "poll" within the Zoom to allow remote eligible voting members to cast their vote. Should it
                occur that all of the Board positions have only a single nominee each, the President will ask for an
                eligible voting member to make a motion to elect the slate of nominees by acclimation. This will negate
                the need for the issuance, collection, or counting of any paper ballots.</p>

            <p>We hope that this article will help everyone to better understand the process. If you have any
                questions, please feel free to email Robert Keister – WZ5V at <span class="hyperlink-light">president@mckinneyarc.org</span></p>

        <h2 class="section-header">📡 She’s On Frequency – A New Voice in Ham Radio</h2>
        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p><strong>She’s On Frequency</strong> is a YouTube channel created by <strong>Elle-Marie DeFrain
                    (KJ5LXP)</strong>,
                a newly licensed ham from Plano, Texas. Through approachable tutorials, candid behind-the-scenes
                moments, and
                stories of both wins and mistakes, Elle-Marie makes amateur radio more welcoming—especially for
                newcomers and
                women in the hobby.</p>

            <p>With a background in Computer Engineering and Software Development, Elle-Marie found radio to be the
                perfect
                hands-on avenue to explore. After earning her Technician license, she purchased her first mobile rig, a
                Yaesu
                FTM-510D, from HRO in Plano. When it came time to install it in her 4Runner, she discovered there was
                little
                guidance available online. Seeing an opportunity, she documented the installation on video—and that
                first
                tutorial launched her channel.</p>

            <p>Since then, <em>She’s On Frequency</em> has grown into a space that highlights practical mobile installs,
                trail-side QSOs, SOTA activations, and the joy of learning on the air. Along the way, Elle-Marie has
                found a
                warm welcome in the McKinney Amateur Radio Club and the broader ham community.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <em>“This hobby is often quiet, a little misunderstood, and definitely lacking in women — so I’m here to
                    bring a fresh voice to the airwaves and make it feel more welcoming.”</em><br><br>
                — Elle-Marie, KJ5LXP

        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>On the <strong>third Sunday of each month</strong>, McKinney Amateur Radio Club Volunteer Examiners (VE)
                gather to administer exams for candidates who are pursuing their Amateur Radio license or looking to
                upgrade their current privileges.</p>

            <p>MARC is proud to have <strong>18 certified VEs</strong>, with <strong>David
                    Hampton</strong> coordinating each
                session to ensure we are fully staffed and ready to serve our community.</p>

            <p>We would like to recognize <strong>David Woods – W5COP</strong> for his incredible dedication. David has
                participated in over <strong>135 VE sessions</strong>! His commitment and service are deeply appreciated
                by MARC and by all the operators who have achieved their licenses with his help.</p>

            <p>If you are interested in becoming a Volunteer Examiner, more information can be found on the ARRL
                website: <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.arrl.org/become-an-arrl-ve" target="_blank"

        <h2 class="section-header">🔌 Electronics 101-D – Digital Electronics (Hands-On)</h2>
        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>The next <strong>Electronics 101 – Hands-On</strong> class, <em>Practical Digital Electronics</em>, will
                be
                held on <strong>Saturday, October 4, 2025</strong>, at <strong>McKinney Fire Station #10 Training
                    Room</strong>,
                1150 Olympic Crossing, McKinney. Class begins at <strong>9:00 AM</strong> and will run until about noon
                (with the room reserved until 2:00 PM if additional time is needed).</p>

            <p>This session will cover core digital principles—how to count and perform math using only ones and zeroes—
                along with an introduction to basic digital building blocks such as timers, AND/OR gates, inverters,
                and flip-flops. Participants will gain hands-on experience with integrated circuit components that bring
                these concepts to life.</p>

            <p><strong>Practical exercises include:</strong></p>
            <ul class="padded-list">
                <li>Constructing a power supply with regulation</li>
                <li>Building a 555 IC timer circuit</li>
                <li>Experimenting with digital logic</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This class offers a unique opportunity to apply digital theory in real time using breadboards and
                components provided by the club. Handouts will also be available for reference and future study.</p>

            <p><strong>What to bring (if available):</strong> your own breadboard, VOM tester, or oscilloscope.
                We are also looking for <em>Elmers</em> to assist with assembly and testing phases.</p>

            <p class="centered-section"><strong>Note:</strong> Participants under 16 years of age will require
                pre-approval
                from Bob (K5CRX) or Geri (KI5OEX).</p>

            <p>We hope to see you on the first Saturday in October!</p>

                members. 4) Act as a marketplace for the buying and selling of amateur radio and computer equipment
                and services. Club members should utilize good judgment with regard to topics or content that are
                posted on the MARC reflector. To that end it is recommended that political and religious topics or
                content be avoided unless directly related to amateur radio. In addition, personal attacks in any
                form will not be tolerated.</p>
