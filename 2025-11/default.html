        <h2 class="section-header">📢 President's Message</h2>
        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>Welcome to November!</p>

            <p>October was an exciting and busy month for us! A big shoutout to Bob DeVance – K5CRX for hosting an
                excellent and informative class on digital electronics. We also had a fantastic time at the MARC Potluck
                POTA BBQ at Bonham State Park. Many members came out to join the fun, along with several Scouts who
                participated in fox hunting and made on-air contacts during Jamboree On The Air.</p>

            <p>A special thank-you goes to Lance Chapman – KM6LMP, Joe Leeper – KJ5BYV, and Kyri Calder – KG5WXZ for
                helping the Scouts get on the air and track down those hidden foxes!</p>

            <p>As we move into November, cooler weather, a major holiday, and Election Day are all on the horizon. Be
                sure to get out and cast your vote. Voting is an important part of our civic duty. Speaking of voting,
                we'll also be holding club officer elections at this month's MARC general meeting. Check out more details
                about the election in this newsletter.</p>

            <p>Thanksgiving is one of our favorite times of the year. This is a chance to gather with family and friends,
                reflect on our blessings, and appreciate our wonderful hobby and the camaraderie within MARC. While
                you're celebrating, consider showing your friends and family a bit of what makes amateur radio so special.
                You might just spark some curiosity and inspire a new operator!</p>

            <p>If you have guests in town, take them out for a fox hunt! We now have three active foxes—Felicia, Steve,
                and our newest addition, Marco, who can be found in the Melissa area. Marco was created by Todd Bachli –
                KJ5INP. For the latest fox hunting updates, check out the fox hunting channel on our Discord server.</p>

            <p>If thinking about Thanksgiving has you craving some good food, we have great news! On Wednesday, November
                12th, from 4–8 PM, Chipotle in McKinney (2014 W University Dr) is hosting a fundraiser for MARC. You'll
                find more details in this newsletter.</p>

            <p>Of course, we can't forget our Saturday morning tradition. Breakfast at IHOP in McKinney (75 &amp; 380).
                Arrive around 7:00 AM to grab a seat, enjoy some pancakes and coffee, and catch up with fellow hams. It's
                the perfect way to start your weekend!</p>

            <p>Here's to a wonderful November filled with good food, family, friendship, and radio fun.</p>

        <h2 class="section-header">🗳️ Voting Procedures for 2026 Election of Board of Directors</h2>
        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>Since we only have elections once per year, we thought it would be a good idea to remind everyone of
                the procedures and processes for the conduct of the Board of Directors election. The MARC Constitution
                and By-Laws have some specific rules and processes that must be followed:</p>

            <p><strong>Eligibility to Vote</strong> – To be eligible to vote in the election, you must be an active
                member of the club (i.e. dues are current) and must have attended at least one regular meeting either
                in-person, via Zoom, or by Proxy within the six months preceding the election. This is one of the
                reasons why we try to be so careful about recording attendance at our regular meetings.</p>

            <p><strong>Voting by Proxy</strong> – If you are eligible to vote, but cannot attend the November meeting
                either in person or via Zoom, you can assign your Proxy to another eligible voting member to cast your
                vote for you. To do this, you will need to send an email to Lance Chapman, KM6LMP stating that you want to
                assign your Proxy to another eligible voting member. In your email, you will need to identify the
                eligible voting member to whom you will be assigning your Proxy. Be sure that you have also notified
                the person to whom you are assigning your Proxy so they will know that they will be casting your vote
                along with their own. It is important to note, that no eligible voting member may cast more than two
                Proxy votes in addition to their own.</p>

            <p><strong>Nominations</strong> – The Nominating Committee will be presenting their nominations for Board
                positions at the beginning of the voting process. You can see who they are recommending before the
                meeting by reviewing the sample ballot that is contained within this edition of the newsletter. During
                the meeting, the President will also call for any further nominations to come from the floor. If you
                want to run for a position, or if you want to nominate someone else for a position, this will be the
                time to do so. Nominations from the floor will require a second and a vote of the membership to place
                the nominee on the ballot.</p>

            <p><strong>Voting</strong> – Eligible voting members physically in attendance will be able to cast their
                vote and any Proxy votes they are carrying during the meeting. For those attending via Zoom, we will
                set up a "poll" within the Zoom to allow remote eligible voting members to cast their vote. Should it
                occur that all of the Board positions have only a single nominee each, the President will ask for an
                eligible voting member to make a motion to elect the slate of nominees by acclimation. This will negate
                the need for the issuance, collection, or counting of any paper ballots.</p>

            <p>We hope that this article will help everyone to better understand the process. If you have any
                questions, please feel free to email Robert Keister, WZ5V at <span class="hyperlink-light">president@mckinneyarc.org</span></p>

            <p>59 +20db shout out and THANK YOU to Robert (WZ5V), Lance (KM6LMP), Kyri (KG5WXZ), and Joe (KJ5BYV) for hosting 8 scouts and 5 scouting parents during the POTA Potluck at Bonham State Park on Saturday, October 18th! They set up a "Jamboree on the Air" station to help scouts connect with other scouts over the airwaves, gave them all a quick CW primer and let them try to key their names on a practice oscillator, and capped off the afternoon with some fox hunting in the park. The scout leader expressed her sincere appreciation for our club's willingness to encourage her youth to learn more about amateur radio. The scouts and their parents all had a fantastic time and are eager to join us again soon for fox hunts and general ham radio high jinks in the future.</p>


            <p>Events like this will help our club nurture and grow our youth program by introducing young folks and their parents to amateur radio in ways that are fun and informative. Thanks again to all who participated! Love to see all the happy faces of youth and their parents learning about both the fun and practical facets of amateur radio!</p>

        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>Another great youth radio event is in the books!</p>

            <p>On Saturday, October 25th, MARC members supported the Lone Star District Merit Badge College organized by Scouting America. A huge thank you to our amazing team: Bob (K5CRX), Dick (N5RKP), John (KC5JMD), Andy (W5KZJ), Wilson (NT5AT) and Chris (K5CTW) for making this event an incredible success! Your energy, preparation and teamwork made all the difference.</p>

            <img src="images/merit-badge-1.jpg" style="width:300px; display: block; margin: auto; margin-top: 20px;">

            <p>Bob and Dick, our instructors, delivered 4+ hours of detailed and wide-ranging content to help two scouts earn the Radio Merit Badge, while also including several real-life anecdotes from their respective storied careers. Both scouts expressed genuine interest in going on to pursue their Technician licenses!</p>

            <img src="images/merit-badge-2.jpg" style="width:300px; display: block; margin: auto; margin-top: 20px;">

            <p>Our radio demonstration crew set up a truly impressive array of antennas and radio gear outside the venue, introducing about 15 scouts and a handful of adults to amateur radio. John's HF station showed FT8 contacts from around the world happening in real-time, Andy set up a UHF/VHF station and helped a bunch of kids conquer their 'mic fright' to make their very first on-air QSO's, and Wilson and Chris instructed groups of scouts in the use of directional antennas to hunt and find "Steve" the fox, who was hiding stealthily in a nearby field. We also really appreciated David (KI5LPO), Tim (KK5TIM), and everyone who monitored our repeaters to make memorable on-air contacts with the youth.</p>

            <img src="images/merit-badge-3.jpg" style="width:300px; display: block; margin: auto; margin-top: 20px;">

            <p>We had a blast and the club received wonderful feedback from the scouts and event organizers from Scouting America. Great job, everyone — and thank you again for helping spark the next generation of hams!</p>

            <p>Let's learn how our antennas perform on selected bands.</p>

            <p>A club go-kit radio will be used to switch between antennas, with similar coax lengths, using reverse beaconing so there is no need to bring your radio. We'll make this as scientific as we can.</p>

            <p>Accessories, such as poles or tripods and connections to SO239 connection might be helpful, we'll have some available. Maybe bring your favorite camp chair.</p>

            <p>Bring your ht's as well. We are working to have some testing available for those as well.</p>

            <p>This is at Lance's RV park, we will have access to shelter and facilities. Please be respectful of the residents.</p>

        <h2 class="section-header">📡 Army MARS Today and Into the Future</h2>
        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <h2>Introduction to Army MARS</h2>
            <p>Military Auxiliary Radio Service (MARS) is an Army sponsored program that organizes, trains, and utilizes Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licensed amateur radio operators, as military Auxiliarists, to contribute to and support the Department of Defense (DoD). Army MARS is made up of private citizen volunteers who employ their own High Frequency (HF) radio stations in support of the DoD and Services. These individuals are organized into a military auxiliary, assigned internationally recognized U.S. Army radio call signs and operate on designated military radio channels. You do not have to have been a member of any military branch of service to become a MARS auxiliarists.</p>

            <p>MARS Auxiliarists are located in communities throughout the United States, its territories and possessions and serve as the principal interface between the DoD and licensed Amateur Radio operators in local communities. During a catastrophe and the immediate aftermath, local amateur radio stations are often the only source of communication, news, and information in the affected area.</p>

            <p>Army MARS Auxiliarists are HF radio Subject Matter Experts and members are expected to mitigate risk in cyberspace, maintain operational and cyber security, recover quickly from a cyber-incident, utilize type three encryption, as well as establish reliable, military interoperable communications over long distances using HF radio when access to cyberspace has been impaired or denied. MARS does not use VHF or UHF communication capability. The communication skills and procedures needed to support the DOD are subject to change at any time. In providing this potential broad range of support, MARS Auxiliarists do not deploy. Auxiliarists provide the contingency of HF network connectivity from their home stations. While many of our MARS members wear multiple hats in their community as radio operators, MARS offers another opportunity in support of that mission. MARS supports DoD Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) efforts by interfacing with Amateur Radio stations in disaster areas, or other Amateur Radio stations that are in contact with the disaster area, to obtain information concerning the conditions, impact and extent of the disaster, and other information pertinent to coordinating a possible U.S. HADR response by interfacing with members of the Amateur Radio Service in the communities throughout the United States, and to process situational awareness information products for DoD.</p>

            <h2>Army MARS Membership</h2>
            <p>Individual MARS Membership is open to civilian, volunteer Amateur Radio operators who desire to support the United States' defense related activities utilizing their Amateur Radio station. Qualifications</p>

            <p>Individuals applying for ARMY MARS membership must meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
            <ul class="padded-list">
                <li>Eighteen Years of age or older</li>
                <li>Citizen of the United States or lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence under 8 USC Chapter 12</li>
                <li>Hold an FCC Amateur Radio license (any class)</li>
                <li>Agree to follow all rules and procedures prescribed by the Chief Army MARS and have a desire to provide voluntary communications support to the defense of the United States</li>
                <li>Have no prior record of being terminated for cause by another Service MARS program</li>
                <li>Agree to the membership agreement, privacy statement, and non-disclosure statement in the Army MARS membership application</li>
                <li>Able to pass a background check, ie: Of good moral character, no felony convictions, or under indictment or information in any court for a felony, no associations with known terrorist organizations, not an unlawful user of illicit drugs, has not been discharged from the Armed Forces for other than honorable conditions, has not been terminated for cause by any MARS service, and has not been declared mentally incompetent.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>ARMY MARS members are expected to meet a minimum, on-going training requirement to retain their skills. A minimum of 72 hours per year (optimally spread over 18 hours per quarter) and active participation in at least one national level exercise is required of MARS members to retain membership.</p>

            <p>You will need to have a radio station capable of transmitting at least 100 watts and capable of being modified to operate between 2-30 MHz on both SSB voice and MIL-STD 188-110A serial PSK mode. A computer system connected to the radio equipment capable of operating the supplied messaging software, for drafting, sending and receiving required messages.</p>

            <h2>The Motivation to Serve</h2>
            <p>Army MARS is a unique activity for most people, requiring a great deal of personal investment for very intangible, perhaps even esoteric personal reward. MARS members do not receive surplus government equipment, nor are they provided with radios or reimbursement. Most MARS members find their service rewarding with the knowledge they are performing a patriotic duty doing something positive that is of essential value to their nation's defense.</p>

            <p>Does this sound like you? Then we welcome you into the Army MARS community. The MARS application below is the first step.</p>

            <p>MARC maintains a chat group on groups.io to facilitate club communication between meetings and

                will be approved quickly.</p>

            <p>The purposes of the MARC email reflector are: 1) Facilitate the timely distribution of MARC
                information and news to club members. 2) Allow for the sharing of amateur radio related topics among
                club members. 3) Provide a forum for the discussion of amateur related information among club
                members. 4) Act as a marketplace for the buying and selling of amateur radio and computer equipment
                and services. Club members should utilize good judgment with regard to topics or content that are
                posted on the MARC reflector. To that end it is recommended that political and religious topics or
                content be avoided unless directly related to amateur radio. In addition, personal attacks in any
                form will not be tolerated.</p>
