        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>Hello MARC Family!</p>

            <p>Welcome to February! While it may be the shortest month of the year, it's certainly packed with fun and excitement. Are you ready for the Super Bowl? There's nothing quite like a great tailgate party at home while watching two teams battle it out for the Vince Lombardi Trophy.</p>

            <p>As if that weren't enough, don't forget Valentine's Day on Saturday, February 14th. There are so many ways to celebrate with your special someone - dinner, a movie, or perhaps the perfect ham-radio twist: getting on the air during a POTA outing! And if you're flying solo, treat yourself—you deserve it. Maybe even splurge on that new radio you've been eyeing. Just remember the flowers and that heart-shaped box of sugary chocolate carbohydrates!</p>

            <p>February weather in Texas can be unpredictable and often cold. Unfortunately, the conditions put a damper on our Winter Field Day event last month, but it serves as a great reminder to stay prepared for weather emergencies. How ready are you for a power outage? Now is the perfect time to tune up the generator, charge those batteries, top off the fuel tank, and review your emergency plan. And as much as we enjoy Groundhog Day, let's not rely on Punxsutawney Phil for accurate Texas weather forecasts!</p>

            <p>On a very positive note, January brought some exciting news. At last month's general meeting, our ARRL North Texas Section Manager, Steven Lott Smith, presented our very own Bob DeVance, K5CRX, with the ARRL North Texas Ham of the Year Award. This honor is well deserved and recognizes all that Bob has done to advance amateur radio. Thank you, Bob, for everything you've given to our club and our hobby!</p>

            <p>And of course, don't forget our Saturday morning tradition, breakfast at IHOP in McKinney (75 & 380). Arrive around 7:00 AM to grab a seat, enjoy some pancakes and coffee, and catch up with fellow hams. It's a great way to start the weekend!</p>

    <section class="content-section">
        <h2 class="section-header">🏆 Congratulations to Bob DeVance, K5CRX — ARRL North Texas Ham of the Year!</h2>
        <article class="flowing-columns">
            <p>The McKinney Amateur Radio Club is thrilled to announce that our very own <strong>Bob DeVance, K5CRX</strong>, has been named the <strong>ARRL North Texas Section Ham of the Year</strong> for 2025. The award was presented at our January general meeting by ARRL North Texas Section Manager Steven Lott Smith, making it a truly memorable evening for all in attendance.</p>

            <p>Bob's dedication to amateur radio and the North Texas ham community exemplifies what it means to be a well-rounded operator who gives back selflessly to both our hobby and the greater community.</p>

            <h1>A Legacy of Club Leadership</h1>
            <p>Bob is one of only six Life Members of the McKinney Amateur Radio Club—a distinction that cannot be purchased. To receive Life Member status, a member must have been active for at least 10 years, be nominated by a fellow member, and receive approval from the majority of the membership. Throughout his tenure, Bob has served in numerous leadership roles including President, Vice President, Communications Director, and Newsletter Editor.</p>

            <h1>Education and Mentorship</h1>
            <p>Bob has demonstrated a tireless dedication to educating hams and aspiring hams throughout North Texas. He has developed and delivered numerous high-quality classes, often providing all supplies, tools, and resources out of his own pocket. His sessions regularly attract up to 30 students eager to learn.</p>

            <p>Some of the classes Bob has delivered include:</p>
            <ul class="padded-list">
                <li>Electronics 101 series (DC Circuits, AC Circuits, Solid State Devices, Digital Principles)</li>
                <li>HT Basics (UHF/VHF)</li>
                <li>Scout Merit Badge instruction at the annual McKinney Merit Badge Boot Camp</li>
                <li>Operating Modes workshops</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Bob delivers these classes to anyone who wants to learn, regardless of club affiliation or license status, helping prepare our community for advancement while giving them practical skills in electronic and communication technology.</p>

            <h1>Technical Excellence</h1>
            <p>Bob has been the principal driver behind many of the technical improvements to the MARC repeater infrastructure, including:</p>
            <ul class="padded-list">
                <li>Configuring and implementing EchoLink integration for the MARC 2m repeater system</li>
                <li>Configuring and implementing Wires-X integration for the MARC 70cm repeater system</li>
                <li>Implementing SCOM repeater controllers across multiple repeaters</li>
                <li>Deploying multiple Yaesu DR-2X repeaters within the MARC infrastructure</li>
                <li>Hosting the Wires-X and EchoLink gateways at his home QTH</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These contributions extend far beyond MARC—our repeater infrastructure is a key component of the Collin County ARES plans, activities, and support of the National Weather Service SKYWARN® program.</p>

            <h1>Inspiring the Next Generation</h1>
            <p>Bob's commitment to youth extends through his work with Scouting programs and his leadership of MARC's GOTA (Get On The Air) stations during Field Day each year. Through these efforts, he has introduced countless young people to the wonder of amateur radio. Bob has also been an enthusiastic participant in MARC's sponsorship of scholarships at the Dallas Area Regional Science Fair, serving on judging panels and contributing to the MARC Youth Fund.</p>

            <h1>A Well-Deserved Honor</h1>
            <p>In recognition of this achievement, Bob was also presented with a MARC Challenge Coin—only the second ever issued by our club.</p>

            <p>Bob exemplifies the best qualities of an amateur radio operator. His professionalism, knowledge, generosity, and willingness to invest his time, energy, and resources inspire us all. Please join us in congratulating Bob on this well-deserved recognition!</p>

            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <strong>73, Bob — and thank you for everything you do for MARC and the amateur radio community!</strong>

            </strong>

            <p>MARC maintains a chat group on groups.io to facilitate club communication between meetings and
                newsletters. Sign up for this service by visiting <span
                    class="hyperlink">https://groups.io/g/McKinneyARC</span>. Your application
                will be approved quickly.</p>

            <p>The purposes of the MARC email reflector are: 1) Facilitate the timely distribution of MARC
                information and news to club members. 2) Allow for the sharing of amateur radio related topics among
                club members. 3) Provide a forum for the discussion of amateur related information among club
                members. 4) Act as a marketplace for the buying and selling of amateur radio and computer equipment
                and services. Club members should utilize good judgment with regard to topics or content that are
                posted on the MARC reflector. To that end it is recommended that political and religious topics or
                content be avoided unless directly related to amateur radio. In addition, personal attacks in any
                form will not be tolerated.</p>
